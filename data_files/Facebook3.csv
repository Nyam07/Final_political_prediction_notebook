Kariso Ke,"Shosh mmoja kutoka Nyeri alienda  Equity bank Center in upperhill kama amebeba gunia imejaa pesa.  Alipofika kwa receptionist alimwambia anataka kuongea na the bank's manager.  Kwa matharau yule receptionist alimwambia ""huwezitoka mahali umetoka ukuje hapa kuorder kuonana na manager without an appointment. manager ako very busy na huwezi kumwuona bila appointment"" ""Lakini niko na pesa mingi sana hapa kwa hii gunia na siwezi deposit kama sijamuona manager"" yule shosh alijibu. So after confirming that the gunia alikuwa imebeba pesa, reception alimwambia angoje kidogo na aliporudi akamwelekeza shosh kwa ofisi ya manager. Alipoingia kwa ofisi ya manager kama amebeba zile pesa, manager alimkaribisha na kumuuliza angeweza kumsaidia vipi. Shosh akamwambia kuwa anataka kufungua a savings account ambayo angedeposit 180 million aliyokuwa amebeba kwa lile gunia lake.  manager alishtuka kusikia kuwa lile gunia lililokuwa juu ya meza yake lilikuwa na pesa mingi hivo na kumuuliza alipotoa hizo pesa zote.  Shosh alimjibu na kumwambia kuwa yeye hufanya betting na kushinda kila wakati ndio maana alikuwa na pesa nyingi hivo.  Kwa mshangao tena, manager alimuuliza ""kwani ni bets aina gani wewe hufanya?"" Shosh akamjibu ""Kwa mfano, nawezabet shilingi 25,000,0000 kuwa hauna sehemu zako za siri na nishinde"" What! sasa unataka tubet kuwa sina sehemu zangu za siri na nnajua vizuri niko nazo. Si utapoteza your 25,000,000!"" manager alijibu kwa mshangao To proof it, shosh akamwambia manager kuwa wakutane the following day kwa ile ofisi yake saa nne ya asubuhi kila mtu akiwa na 25,000,000. Shosh pia aliongezakuwa atakuja na lawyer wake sababu kiwango cha pesa walikuwa wanabet nikikubwa sana na nivizuri kuinvolve a lawyer. Manager akakubali na wakakubaliana kupatana the following day.  Usiku huo, manager alishinda na wasiwasi sana akijiuliza kwanini yule shosh alimwambia kuwa hana sehemu za siri na kumake it worse ako ready to bet a lot of money to that effect yet yeye ako sure sehemu zake za siri zilikuweko. Manager akajiangalia kuconfirm kuwa sehemu zake za siri ziko kisha akatoa 25,000,000 from his safe na kuweka kwa briefcase ready for work the following day.  Shosh na lawyer wake wakafika kwa ofisi ya manager at exactly saa nne asubuhi.  Akaambia manager atoe trouser waconfirm kama alikuwa na sehemu zake za siri. So sure of it, and knowing pesa ilikuwa involved, manager akateremsha trouser na shosh akaanza kushikashika sehemu zake za siri kuhakikisha kuwa zipo.  Lawyer alipoona kilichokuwa kikiendelea, aligonga ukuta kwa mshangao na hasira kisha akaketi kama mtu ameshikwa na stress at once. Manager alishtuka kuona reaction ya lawyer na kuuliza shosh ""Kwani lawyer wako anashida gani?"" Shosh akajibu ""Lawyer wangu hana shida yeyote ila tulibet nayeye for 100,000,0000 shilings kwamba leo saa nne nitakuwa nimeshika sehemu zako za kwa mikono yanguüòÇ"" Please follow Funny"
