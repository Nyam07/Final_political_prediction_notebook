Peter Maya,"Hon Sabina Chege today tried to wear a brave face at IEBC offices shielded by Otieno Kanjwang, sen Orengo, Hon. Otiende Hon. Baby Owino and others. Am wondering where the likes of Hon Anne Waiguru,Hon Cate Waruguru,Hon Alice Wahome to protect you as a daughter of the mountain. Of course you ran away to Nyanza  and never want to say hi to your sisters from the mountain. What she said about 2017 elections was absurd; That handshake spirit is demolishing warriors of the moutain. They have said that you have a case to answer,hard times ahead."

I wondered where akina Gathoni, Waruguru, Waiguru to protect you as a daughter of the mountain. Of course you ran away to Nyanza  and never want to say hi to your sisters....... The same spirit that attacked our SON has NOW attacked you. What you said about 2017 elections was absurd; yes you are known to be a controlled girl, very intelligent but hio shetani alikuweza.  Sabina tafadhali kuja tuombe ndio huyo saitani akuondokee wewe na our beloved SON. That handshake spirit is demolishing warriors of the moutain,we must defeat it! They said you have a case to answer, hio inahitaji Mungu  Toka Nyanza,rudi Murang'a tutafunga dada yangu tuombe. Kana atia?  Wamuchomba to Sabina Chege"
