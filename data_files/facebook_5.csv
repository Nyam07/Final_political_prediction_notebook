Lutta Hillary,Making a mountain out of a mole hill. Tell the Congolese that in Kenya 'cow' is a metaphor meaning 'foolish'. Ruto therefore meant DRC has a shortage of fools. He however should watch his tongue next time.
Chrixtopher Kaloki,"He finally came to his senses so late. He should have done it before sending emisaries to go calm the waters with congolese delegatión. Anyway, Its a good start hopefully he grasped something from his remarks."
Achieng J. Ouko,The DPs lies went international and Congolese never took it lightly. Good that they're making amends.
Timothy Masinde,Incoming foreign affairs Cs  in KK government at it already.

Pitah Mugambi,Mr fix it.... DRC demands Raila to apologise to both The incoming President of republic of Kenya and to the nation of DRC for taking WSR 's  light words out of context ....
Kossogo Maldini,"Africa's chief mediator died long ago years after ensuring that peace and coexistence had been restored in this beautiful country which was being torn apart by the loose talk,foul language,abusive speech polluted and filled with hate and rotten words!.In whose he hands are we safe now that we have started to witness diplomatic mediations which he have started 6 months down the line?. This country should just be disbanded and everybody should go home!!"
Caltex Davis Rono,DP Ruto was just testing if that international  Relations team can work.. Waiting for media update
Victor Calvin Kitoko,After abusive and intolerance words. What exactly are you convincing an innocent woman to understand instead of facing the higher office in Kinshasa Congo 🇨🇩
Dennis B Orina,After this meeting ensure you plan a bigger one in Kinshasa. Take WSR with you. While there ask him to kneel down and withdrawal his statement properly. Let him promise to never again belittle the richest country in Africa (of course in terms of natural resources)
Cindy's Den Lupper,So the whole team went to apologize ..uda mko na pesa and who catered the flight and hotels..ruto is rich in deed
Philip Obura,"How to appeal to masses?   - Use words that are emotionally charged, but have no specific meaning   (RHETORIC)   (Words such as 'Freedom' 'Justice' 'Greatness' 'Equality')   - Talk 100 sentences, have 0-1 concrete pieces of information   Talk a lot and say nothing.   Make sure everything you say appeals to their emotions, and does not require them to think by giving concrete information or clear chains of logical reasoning.   How to make very intelligent, Rich and Powerful people to take you seriously:   - Give concrete information that is useful and relevant  - If you talk a lot and say nothing, they will be annoyed. If you speak for 100 sentences, there better be 90+ pieces of concrete information."

Hillary Butwo,William Ruto was testing if Ababu was upto task.
Geoffrey Koros,"Thanks Hon.Ababu,they all got it wrong on what His Excellency the DP was saying and due to politics try to mudsling Him and cause diplomatic row."
Sharon Heinman,"Dont mind her, they like conflict they even go slaping people on peoples territory and  she can pretend she is talking on behalf of DRC.  Side shows and attention  sbe want to come and live in kenya"
